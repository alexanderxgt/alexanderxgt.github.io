Last week I set up a proper environment for Haskell and live coding music. I also did some research on templates for the GitHub website to give it a professional sheen.

I plan to spiff up the website next week to meet the deadline.

There are no impediments on my way to meet this goal.

I feel like I hit a good stride this week. I spread work throughout the week, in dedicated time slots, and it worked out fantastically.
