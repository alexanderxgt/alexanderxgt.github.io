This week I researched live coding and decided that producing a 30-minute live coded techno set will be my project for this class. It will help me engage actively with the algorave scene in SF – a bunch of them work in tech! At the moment, I mostly do techno/house, and those crowds lean heavily towards creative fields.

This week I really need to work on my GitHub page. It’s so bare bones and I hate showing it to others hah. Plus, I want to host my live coded sets on GitHub, including the code, so this is crucial to the project.

I am really busy with 3 other classes, but I can work progressively towards a presentable website, so doing SOMETHING is definitely achievable. It does not need to be a finished product by next week.

On my calendar, I realize that I should put dedicated slots to work on my project for this course. This will be more productive.
