__What did you do last week?__

Last week I managed to set up and deploy this website using Ruby and a Jekyll template! It's a work in progress and you can tell a template was used, but it's a start!
I also started playing around with Haskell and live coding, after setting up my environment in previous weeks. It's pretty intuitive. 

__What do you plan to do this week?__

This week I need to finish constructing this website and add my own flair to it. I want to connect it to Soundcloud and to be able to post music links on here,  since live coding is my personal project for the course.

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

School, as always. 

__Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?__

I tried powering through things without reading the documentation and wasted a lot of time. The template is fool proof, as I found out, I just needed to read how it worked. Oops!
