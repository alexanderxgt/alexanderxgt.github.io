__What did you do last week?__

I did some updates to my website since it was in template mode still. 
I freshened up certain things, removed pages, added pages plus social links.
As I said last week, it was enough to show to class, but not use as a professional site.

__What do you plan to do this week?__

It still could be better. I'm using stock images and I need to replace them with something that feels like me. 
I also feel like I know what I'm doing in SonicPI (mostly) so I want to start working on my final stab at something that I'd want to share publicly (and to wrap up the course)

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

Finals.
