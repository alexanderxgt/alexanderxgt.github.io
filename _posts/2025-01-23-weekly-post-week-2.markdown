__What did you do last week?__

Last week I opened ‘alumni connect’ pages for organizations I am part of: Society of Professional Hispanic Engineers, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Columbia Alumni Association. I am hoping to connect with alumni that could chat to the class about their career paths and how to land a job in this market.

__What do you plan to do this week?__

This week I re-opened my LinkedIn, created this webpage, and followed with my in-person network about potentially bringing them ‘to class’ for coffee chats. Two of my close friends in SF work at Amazon and Google and helped me land a job at Amex. They could be useful to other students!

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

Everyone aforementioned, explicitly and otherwise, is a busy person. But I don’t see how I could land one or two speakers.

__Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?__

I should probably give myself more time and ‘pepper in’ work throughout the week. I did everything in a single 3-4 hour session and that disrupted my day just a bit. But that’s a personal issue.
