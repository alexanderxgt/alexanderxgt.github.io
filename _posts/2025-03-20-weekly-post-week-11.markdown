__What did you do last week?__

I'm back on the grind after Spring Break and being ugly-sick for a week or so. 
I move to New York for my job in a month, and I'd like to keep going with this newfound hobby so I had my livecoding friends in San Francisco introduce me to their friends in NYC. The scene in Brooklyn seems to be as large if not larger than the one in SF, so there'll be avenues to continue exploring this over there. Plus, it's still great networking. The folks I've talked to all work in tech, naturally. 


__What do you plan to do this week?__
I've been following a couple of YouTube tutorials in SonicPI to smooth out some of the smaller details of usage. I also think I may need to sit down and do some tutorials in basic music theory. I don't think I can get away with just hamfistinf code and hoping it sounds nice for much longer. 

The website also needs to be updated. Some of the New York folks asked if I had one and I couldn't bring myself to give them the link hah. It still depends on its template. 

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

Finals season, of course.
