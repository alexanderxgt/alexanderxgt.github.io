__What did you do last week?__



Last week I did some professional development mini-courses from LinkedIn and CU Boulder’s career services office. I had the following to say about it:



I really appreciate having done CU’s career mind map activity. It forces you to contend with yourself and the experiences—personal, career, and otherwise—that make you, “you.” I had my story for the career pivot (from law to data engineering) and knew what’s important to me, but had never documented it in a formal manner. I even learned new things about myself! I now feel more confident of what I want from my career (and life) and will take this with me into my first tech job, which starts in July. I feel (slightly…) readier to hit the ground running.

I also did some LinkedIn time management courses and will be applying some of that advice into my routine. I particularly enjoyed videos on time management as a remote worker. I let work/school bleed into ‘me time’ and vice-versa, and while that hasn’t been an impediment so far, I don’t think it makes any more efficient. Some structure couldn’t hurt. I particularly like the invitation to separate personal and workspaces. I’m terrible at that and, now that I think about it, it messes with my mood and productivity to blend all my spaces. I’m more efficient when I don’t work in my room.



I also checked in on the algorithmic rave / live coding scene in San Francisco to see if they have any upcoming events. They had a party that showed up in local media last fall, but seem to have not done anything since Halloween. The Bay does get sleepy until March, or so, to be fair. I want to network with that crowd, to combine tech and my musical pursuits.



I did get in touch with someone that live coded at one of their parties, though! He works as an engineer by day. We should be getting coffee soon.



__What do you plan to do this week? Are there any impediments in your way?__



Survive, mostly. I have two exams and two projects due this week, so it’s really hard focusing on personal development, but I will be following up with that live coder!
