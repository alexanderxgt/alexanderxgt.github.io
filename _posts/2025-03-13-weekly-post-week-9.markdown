__What did you do last week?__

As explained in better detail in my project update report, I re-tooled my project and went back to square one. Daunting! But I suppose that, in the end, this is a learning experience, and I don’t have a hard deadline to produce a performance-ready set. I am learning properly and under supervision now, which is exciting. Forward progress is good, even if it means taking a couple of steps back to get impulse. I am on the right path now, which I wasn’t earlier in the semester.

Over the weekend I’m getting a Sonic PI lesson from people that live-code at events. This is the environment I should have been using all along… oops!


__What do you plan to do this week? Are there any impediments in your way?__

Over the weekend I’m getting a Sonic PI lesson from people that live-code at events. This is the environment I should have been using all along… oops! I talk about that in my report.

Right now, I’m working through the tutorial for Strudel REPL which is a web based live-coding tool my new mentors recommended. It’s not meant for live performance, but it’s great for learning. I want to produce a few loops here before moving on to big boy stuff (Sonic PI).

I have a lot of deadlines for other classes with break approaching, so this may be hard to do, but I’m glad I have the weekend lesson to keep me accountable and moving forward.
