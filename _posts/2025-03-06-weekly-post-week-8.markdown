__What did you do last week?__

With the project update report coming up, I’ve begun stabbing away at my first live coded set, which I hope to share on my GitHub website. It should be the length of a song (less than 5 minutes) and attempt to recreate a minimal Berlinesque techno sound, a la Ben Klock or dvs1. I am finding that live coding rich, complex melodies is a bit hard (for a beginner anyways). But minimal techno should be something that an algorithm excels at. It’s simple, clean, repetitive.


__What do you plan to do this week? Are there any impediments in your way?__

I am actually seeing Ben Klock tomorrow and perhaps I’ll find some inspiration. I am thinking that, for my first ‘output’ trying to ‘cover’ a song (or a snippet of his set) could be a worthy project. It eliminates the uncertainty of creating my own song, and allows me to focus on my live coding skills. I’ll know I’ve succeeded if my first set sounds anything like what I’m trying to cover. That’s something I’ll be including in my report under ‘updated goals’
Thankfully I am done with my hellish Midterms Season, so I am planning to focus on this until next week! So excited.
