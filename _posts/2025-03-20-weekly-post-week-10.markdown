__What did you do last week?__

I got a lesson in Sonic PI from people in the live coding scene in San Francisco and began my own experimentations with it. I feel like I'm actually making progress now, imagine that! I'm glad I reached out to people. 

__What do you plan to do this week?__

Work on making something on Sonic PI, I'm also hunting for libraries I can integrate into my workflow with techno-y sounds. Vanilla Sonic PI is a little lacking on that end. It'll require research of my own. 

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

Thankfully not, yipee, Spring Break! I'm going to be indulgent and just live code all week.
