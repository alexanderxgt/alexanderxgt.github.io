__What did you do last week?__

I’ve been absorbed in the hunt for apartments in New York City (a hellish experience that makes me question if I could even recommend the city to others…) since I leave San Francisco for that new data engineering job in less than a month. I will say, networking and community gives dividends! Befriending people in the live coding scene in SF led me to befriend people in the live coding scene in New York, and those people regularly send offline rooms and apartments that I could rent.
Seems like tomorrow might finally be the day where I secure something, fingers crossed! I may just end up in Bushwick, where the underground music scene is based, and that’s exciting. The entire point of getting into live coding was networking and my network’s already helping me out.
As for functional things deeply related to the project, I’m brushing up on music theory. I realized that I’m terrible at measuring BPM ‘by ear’ and that’s kind of the whole point of techno DJing.  ‘Beatmatching’ is a skill I should’ve tried to figure out earlier on, but we learn as we walk.

__What do you plan to do this week?__

If I’m not talking to realtors and people looking for roommates 24/7 (I kid you not, this has been my entire week from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed, the NYC market is bananas…) I want to figure out how to upload music to my website so I can share what I’ve been working on. Shouldn’t be too hard and it’ll feel slicker than sending people to SoundCloud via a link.

__Are there any impediments in your way?__

The 24/7 apartment hunt… my lord I really hope it’s done tomorrow.
